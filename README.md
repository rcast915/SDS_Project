# SDS_Project
Final Project for SDS




Final Project Idea:

Recipe Generator
The user will be able to enter input
That input could be used to query a database
Calls will be made to a gen AI API for text and images
Gen AI output will be returned and displayed to the user 
Our web application will have the capability to generate personalized recipes for specific dishes based on user input. The core functionality of our application will involve working with the ingredients available in the user's kitchen, providing customized choices to match their available ingredients and cooking resources. Furthermore, it will excel in suggesting the purchase of missing ingredients by identifying the nearest store to the user's location. To develop the visual and descriptive experience, we will make calls to the Gen AI API for the generation of images and text related to the ingredients and dishes.



Fitness Page:
Recipe Generator
The user will be able to enter input
That input could be used to query a database
Calls will be made to a gen AI API for text and images
Gen AI output will be returned and displayed to the user 
There would be another web page for a fitness/health option. It would work the same as the first webpage, receiving a user input of ingredients to provide customized choices. However, it will provide healthy choices and substitutions for the ingredients to have less calories, more protein, etc. As well as providing directions to the nearest store for said ingredients. To develop the visual and descriptive experience, we will make calls to the Gen AI API for the generation of images and text related to the ingredients and dishes.


Recipe Generator
The user will be able to enter what recipe they want
That input could be used to query a database
Calls will be made to a gen AI API for a list of ingredients and recipe
Gen AI output will be returned and displayed to the user 


There would be a third function for the web app that works as the complement to the main function of the app. Instead of the user selecting which items they have and then generating a recipe from that. We would implement the reverse where the User inputs a dish they would like and then the app would provide ingredients and a recipe to create that recipe. Possibly utilizing the same logic of the first two pages where the user can decide how health conscious the recipe is and could even provide location of the nearest grocery store to purchase said ingredients.
