# SDS_Project
Final Project for SDS




Final Project Idea:

Recipe Generator
The user will be able to enter input
That input could be used to query a database
Calls will be made to a gen AI API for text and images
Gen AI output will be returned and displayed to the user 
Our web application will have the capability to generate personalized recipes for specific dishes based on user input. The core functionality of our application will involve working with the ingredients available in the user's kitchen, providing customized choices to match their available ingredients and cooking resources. Furthermore, it will excel in suggesting the purchase of missing ingredients by identifying the nearest store to the user's location. To develop the visual and descriptive experience, we will make calls to the Gen AI API for the generation of images and text related to the ingredients and dishes.
